# Avalanche DEX Ecosystem Analysis: User Segmentation, Retention & Growth (Traders & Liquidity Providers)
[Full Dashboard](https://joshuatochinwachi.github.io/Liquidity-providers-and-traders-segmentation-on-Avalanche-DEXs-and-their-behavioral-analysis/) | [Data story telling on ùïè](https://x.com/defi__josh/status/1927992581989781746)

This dashboard and entire analysis was built and developed using [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz) by me. Unfortunately, Flipside‚Äôs querying and dashboarding tool has gone dark because of their collaboration with [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/).

Flipside also used Snowflake‚Äôs SQL dialect as their SQL flavor when they were active, so the SQL code you‚Äôll see in this project‚Äîfor both querying and dashboarding‚Äîis very similar to Snowflake‚Äôs syntax.

Using [Python scripts](https://github.com/joshuatochinwachi/Flipside_dashboard_porter), I scraped my Flipside dashboard and visualizations from the Flipside website.

## Queries/Metrics used

### 1. Avalanche DEX User Segmentation and Retention Analysis by Trading Volume Tiers

```
/*
Title: Avalanche DEX User Segmentation and Retention Analysis by Trading Volume Tiers

Description: Comprehensive analysis of DEX user behavior, segmented by wallet tiers,
including metrics for user retention, churn, activity, and volume across different trader categories

Aim: To provide comprehensive insights into user trading behavior on Avalanche DEXes through wallet segmentation and behavioral analysis, enabling data-driven protocol optimization and user engagement strategies.

-----Key Metrics Coverage
User Base: Active users, new users, churned users
Activity: Total swaps, trading volume (USD)
Performance: Average metrics per user
Retention: Cohort retention, reactivation rates

-----Analysis Boundaries
Exclusive focus on swap transactions
Wallet-based user identification
USD value derived from transaction timestamps
Monthly aggregation level


This analysis serves as a foundation for protocol development, marketing strategies, and user experience enhancement, following Flipside's IDG framework for comprehensive growth analytics.

### 2. Avalanche DEX Liquidity Provider Analytics: User Segmentation & Behavioral Analysis

```
/*
TITLE: Avalanche DEX Liquidity Provider Analytics: User Segmentation & Behavioral Analysis

DESCRIPTION: Comprehensive analysis of LP user behavior, segmented by wallet tiers,
including metrics for user retention, churn, activity, volume, and platform-specific metrics

AIM: To provide a comprehensive understanding of liquidity provider behavior across Avalanche's DEX ecosystem through the lens of user acquisition, engagement, retention, and monetization. This analysis segments users into distinct tiers based on their liquidity provision volume, tracking their journey from entry to sustained participation while measuring cross-platform engagement patterns and value creation metrics.

DATA COVERAGE:
Time Frame: Rolling 12-Month Window
Blockchain: Avalanche
Protocol Type: Decentralized Exchanges
Data Sources: ez_token_transfers, dim_dex_liquidity_pools, ez_dex_swaps

ANALYTICAL BOUNDARIES:
- Focus on liquidity addition events
- Exclusion of withdrawal metrics
- Platform coverage: TraderJoe, Pangolin, Pharaoh, and other major DEXs
- Limited to direct DEX interactions


This analysis serves as a strategic tool for understanding LP behavior patterns, market dynamics, and platform performance within the Avalanche DEX ecosystem, providing actionable insights through the IDG framework.
