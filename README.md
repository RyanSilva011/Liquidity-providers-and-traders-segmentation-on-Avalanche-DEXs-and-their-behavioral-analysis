# Avalanche DEX Ecosystem Analysis: User Segmentation, Retention & Growth (Traders & Liquidity Providers)
[Full Dashboard](https://joshuatochinwachi.github.io/Liquidity-providers-and-traders-segmentation-on-Avalanche-DEXs-and-their-behavioral-analysis/) | [Data story telling on ùïè](https://x.com/defi__josh/status/1927992581989781746)

This dashboard and entire analysis was built and developed using [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz) by me. Unfortunately, Flipside‚Äôs querying and dashboarding tool has gone dark because of their collaboration with [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/).

Flipside also used Snowflake‚Äôs SQL dialect as their SQL flavor when they were active, so the SQL code you‚Äôll see in this project‚Äîfor both querying and dashboarding‚Äîis very similar to Snowflake‚Äôs syntax.

Using [Python scripts](https://github.com/joshuatochinwachi/Flipside_dashboard_porter), I scraped my Flipside dashboard and visualizations from the Flipside website.
